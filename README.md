## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Databases. My studies and personal projects have equipped me with practical experience in C++, C, Python, Java, and web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Currently, I am an intern at a tech company. I began in technical support and now work as a QA member of the development team, gaining insight into both user-facing issues and the software development lifecycle.

## Featured Project: Spatial Data Indexing

A highlight of my academic work is a project on spatial data management, where I implemented an R*-tree structure for secondary memory. The system was designed for:

- Efficient storage and querying of multidimensional spatial data (supporting more than just 2D/3D)
- Range queries, k-nearest neighbor, and skyline queries
- Insertion, deletion, and bulk loading of records
- Integration of real-world data from OpenStreetMap, managing unique IDs, names, and coordinates
- Custom file storage with fixed-size blocks and a separate index for fast lookups

Through this project, I developed a deeper understanding of spatial databases, advanced data structures, and robust software engineering principles.

## Beyond the Code

Outside of programming, I enjoy gaming, traveling, and spending time outdoors—especially camping and hiking.

## Let's Connect

I'm always open to new collaborations and connections. If you’re interested in working together or just want to discuss technology or ideas, feel free to get in touch.
